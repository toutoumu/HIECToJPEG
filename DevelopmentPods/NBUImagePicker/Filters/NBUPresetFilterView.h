/**
 An view to ease applying preset filters to an image.
 
 - Simply use image setter and getter to apply the current filter.
 - Preset and arbitrary number of preset (preconfigured) filters.
 - NBUFilter thumbnails are presented in a ObjectSlideView.
 - Optimize performance using scaled down thumbnails and working images for previews.
 - Async image processing using Grand Dispatch Central.
 - Filtered previews' caching for quick switching between filters.
 - Observes UIApplicationDidReceiveMemoryWarningNotification to release cached previews on low memory conditions.
 - UI can be completely customized using Nib files.
