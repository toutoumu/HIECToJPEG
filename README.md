## Demo

A demo project is [included](Demo) in the repository.

### Image Picker

Block-based UIImagePickerController replacement with as many/few features as you [need](#installation).

Enable/disable modules or use them [stand-alone](#stand-alone-modules).

### Camera

Customizable AVFoundation-based camera UIView.

Can be embeded into any superview, custom UIViewController or used along NBUCameraViewController.
It even takes mock pictures in the iOS Simulator!

### Assets

Multiple classes of all three MVC categories to simplify access to AssetsLibrary while observing its
change notifications to stay always in a valid state.

Also support for _local assets_: Images in custom directories that are displayed like regular Assets Library albums.

Uses filters from CoreImage and [GPUImage](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) and can be extended to
other libraries as well.

### Image Gallery

Image slideshow in development inspired by [FGallery](https://github.com/gdavis/FGallery-iPhone).

## Customization

The main goal of NBUImagePicker is to be fully [customizable](https://github.com/CyberAgent/iOS-NBUKit/wiki/NBUKit-Customization) and easy to extend.

Change element's sizes, position, customize picker workflow, add/remove/rename filters, localize for other languages, use cropping features from [other](https://github.com/kishikawakatsumi/PEPhotoCropEditor) libraries, etc.
